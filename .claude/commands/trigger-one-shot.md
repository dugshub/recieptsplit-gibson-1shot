# Trigger One-Shot Challenge

You are about to begin the GibsonAI OneShot Hackathon Challenge for the SplitReceipt application.

This command will load all necessary context and guide you through implementing a complete receipt splitting application
in a single shot, using GibsonAI for the backend and the GibsonAI Next.js starter app for the frontend.

# SplitReceipt One-Shot Challenge

You are participating in the GibsonAI OneShot Hackathon Challenge, tasked with building a complete receipt splitting application in a single shot.

## Challenge Overview

Your goal is to implement SplitReceipt, a full-stack application that allows users to:
1. Create trips/events with multiple members
2. Upload and process receipts
3. Split expenses among trip members
4. Calculate balances between users

This implementation will use GibsonAI MCP for the backend and the GibsonAI Next.js starter app for the frontend.

## Implementation Strategy

NOTE: THE ENTIRE DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION IS AVAILABLE IN @ai-docs/step-by-step-implementation.md

To effectively implement this challenge, you should:

1. Follow the numbered steps in the step-by-step-implementation.md guide precisely
   - The guide provides clear, sequential steps with exact instructions
   - Execute each step in the exact order provided
   - Use the exact commands and responses specified

2. The implementation is organized into five distinct phases:
   - STEP 1: BACKEND CREATION - Create GibsonAI backend
   - STEP 2: FRONTEND SETUP - Set up Next.js app with GibsonAI script
   - STEP 3: UI ENHANCEMENT - Add ShadCN UI components
   - STEP 4: FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION - Build core features
   - STEP 5: TESTING - Verify functionality

3. Pay special attention to:
   - Using the GibsonAI setup script correctly (entering "." when prompted for directory)
   - Implementing error recovery steps when needed
   - Using ShadCN UI components explicitly instead of plain HTML

4. After each major phase, mark it as completed and proceed to the next step

## Implementation Execution

Your role is to:

1. Understand the complete implementation requirements
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation guide precisely
3. Pay careful attention to interactive prompts and their expected responses
4. Mark each step as completed as you progress
5. Use the reference documents when you need additional context
6. Track any issues encountered and apply the provided error recovery steps

## Let's Begin

Start by reading the step-by-step implementation guide thoroughly, then proceed with executing each step in sequence.

You MUST use the mcp__gibson__* tools to interact with GibsonAI for creating the backend.

IMPORTANT REMINDER: When using the GibsonAI setup script, you MUST enter "." (just a period) when prompted for the project directory to avoid creating nested project structures.

Begin now! Good luck with your implementation.
